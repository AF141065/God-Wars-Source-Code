# God-Wars-Source-Code
A small video game that I've made in C++, influenced by Armies of Gielinor. Unfortunately, I do not have the images that the .cpp file requires, so you may need to recreate the 
images suggested in the image loading section of the code. Additionally, this code uses SDL (the latest version) as a dependency.
